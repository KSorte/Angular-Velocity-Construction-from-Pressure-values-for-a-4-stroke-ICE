# Angular-Velocity-construction-from-Pressure for a 4-stroke IC Engine
The Cylinder_misfire_project.docx file is the source data file for this project. This file contains the pressure graphs. The text files contain the extracted values of 
pressure using the Get Data Graph Digitiser at 73 points at an interva of 10 degrees. The MATLAB code torque_calc.mlx reads these text files and uses them for torque calculation.
AngularVelocty_calc.mlx calculates kinetic energy and then angular velocity values. The healthy cylinder graph is superimposed with the misfiring cylinder graphs for comparison.
